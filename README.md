## Hey guys üëã

My name is Ryan, and i've been into this dark world since 2016 when I first met C. Oh dear C...
Then I was introduced to PHP, HTML, CSS and JS _(breath)_, and **BAMM** Web Developer.
Recently I've just taken my bags and moved out from PHP's house, and now I'm living under node's bridge with my old friend JS. It's been crazy since then

I've tried a lot of projects, but as I'm stupid I lose most of them all the time. Now I'm working on a shopping list WebApp using `NodeJs` and now it's in God's hands, amen üôè

I've been studying ReactJS and React Native since last year _2020_, and have been working on personal projects. RocketSeat have most part of the credit of the application I'm building, 'cause they literally took my hand and said "Let's go Dev, time to code with the future", and I use React in most part of my projects. So, yes, I **AM** a React enthusiast, sue me.
